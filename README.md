# Liferay Text Style Switcher

No more manually switching text styles in Figma. This plugin simply swaps a Lexicon text style to itâ€™s corresponding Analytics Cloud text style, or vice versa. It can be done for a selected text box or across an entire page in Figma at once.

Caveats: You'll need a copy of the text style you're switching to in your Figma doc for this to work. Plugins can't read styles from linked Libraries yet. A quick way to do this is to add the "Typography" frame from either the Lexicon or Analytics Cloud libraries somewhere in your doc.

This plugin isn't available in Figma yet, so you'll need to clone this repo or download the files. After that you can add it in Figma by selecting "Create your own plugin" in the bottom right of the the plugins section. Add the manifest.json file from this repo and you're good to go.

See [Figma's Developer documentation](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/intro/) for more info.
